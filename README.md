# Assignment_1_v3
 This is my first assignment for data structures and algorithms.
 My task is to build a java application to represent the storage and arrangement of items inside a jewellery store using
 the linked list data structure to represent a hierarchy of display cases, display trays, items of jewellery and each material on every item of jewellery.
